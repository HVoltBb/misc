    "\n",
    "Have you noticed that many people managed to get a perfect score for this problem? 100% correct. I wouldn't expect any machine learning algorithm to perform this good, and you should think this way too. One way to obtain a perfect score is to check manually the survival status of each person in the test set. A perfectly viable solution, but not Pythonic at all!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "A better solution, in my opinion, is to use web scraping to gather that info from the internet. Solving the problem this way will not garrentee a perfect score, but will substantially reduce the problem to the extent that can be solved by hand. For example, check a few dozen names on the internet instead of hundreds of names.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution has two parts. Part 1 is the web crawller which is straight forward and hosted [here](https://github.com/HVoltBb/misc/src/kaggle/titantic/crawler.py) on GitHub. Part 2 is the data processing part, and it is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous online sources that you can crawl, but the one I used is the [Encyclopedia TITANICA](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivors/). You may also use the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passengers_of_the_Titanic), which also has a well formated table.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: I know some of you will hate this solution. You don't have to like it. But by doing this exercise, you learn far more about this problem than simply running some packaged models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the effort is spent on transforming non-ascii characters into ascii characters. You will see more below.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: Also note that I wrote this notebook on my own laptop. Some of the statements require Python 3.8+, and Python on kaggle is 3.7, and you will get syntax errors if you execute this notebook on kaggle. You may convert those statements to be 3.7 compatible by typing some extra characters."
